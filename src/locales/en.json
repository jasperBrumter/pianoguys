		"subfield3": "The action is the connecting device between the player and the piano. You push down the key, at the far end of the key is the damper lever, which is now lifted off the string, then a series of devices send the hammer upwards striking the string and making a sound. The damper then shuts down the sound when the key is released."

		"quote": "Rebuilding pianos is not just a job, It’s a calling; a time honored craft performed by artisans who really know and care about pianos. A piano is not just a piece of furniture, but rather an instrument capable of reacting to a player’s emotions, technique and creativity. Three pianos of the same make, size and close in years can sound as different as night and day. They can be dark and mysterious or rich and singing.",
